# GC modeling with pulsar timing

In this repo we make available extra plots not included in the paper as well as full sampler outputs
and datafiles.

The `GCfit` datafiles for each cluster are in the `data_files` directory. The `GCfit` datafiles
contain all of the data used to fit the models in the paper, including the pulsar timing data.

For each of the 6 fits run in the paper we provide some extra plots not included in the paper and
the full `GCfit` output files. The `GCfit` output files contain the full sampler output, including
the posterior samples for all of the parameters in the model and can be used to reproduce various
plots and results in the paper.

See the `GCfit` [documentation](https://gcfit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information on the
`GCfit` output files and how to use them.
